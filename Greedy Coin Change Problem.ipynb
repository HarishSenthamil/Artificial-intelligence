    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "Given an amount of money and a set of coin denominations, the goal is to make the exact amount using the fewest number of coins. The coin change problem can be represented as a search problem where each state represents a different amount of money left to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "State Space Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "State: The current amount of money that still needs to be made (remaining amount).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial State: The total amount that needs to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal State: A remaining amount of 0 (meaning the exact amount has been made).\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions: Subtract a denomination's value from the current remaining amount (equivalent to choosing a coin).\n",
    "\n",
    "State Transition: Moving from one state to another by choosing a coin and reducing the remaining amount accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: The number of coins used to reach the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristic (H): Typically, a heuristic can be the remaining amount itself, aiming to minimize it, or an estimate based on the largest coin denomination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example where the available denominations are {1, 5, 10, 25} cents, and the goal is to make 111 cents."
